## 2024-10-16
- Changed `batch_size` from 32 to 64
  - Reason: Decreased training time.
- Changed `learning_rate` from 1e-5 to 2e-5
  - Reason: Changed learning rate to match the change in batch size.
- unchanged `num_epochs` from 20
  - Reason: No reason given.
- Changed 'optimizer' from 'adam' to 'sgd'
  - Reason: Changed optimizer to converge slower.


## 2024-10-28
- Changed `batch_size` to 64
  - Reason: Decreased training time.
- Changed `learning_rate` to 1e-4
  - Reason: 2e-5 was too low to converge.
- unchanged `num_epochs` to 1
  - Reason: No reason given.
- Changed 'optimizer' to adam
  - Reason: adam is faster than sgd.
- Changed from tf model to pytorch model
  - Reason: l1 loss is 0.08895214647054672 for validation set after one epoch.
